## Instructions


Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

1-simply open index.html after unzipping folder.

2-get the character to move across the gray bricks towards the water without getting hit by the enemies.

The user's score increases by one point for each level passed. The number of enemy bugs also increase with each level and are randomly placed across the gray bricks at the start of each game.
